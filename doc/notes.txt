Changing the structure of the work - adding in fermionic mapping


# 7.10.18

So far, have added orbital optimizations to the program pretty successfully.
Unfortunately, large changes were made to the IBM code, and so now a slew of
things need to be carried out. 

1. Essentially, rebuild the framework. We know now more or less what we need, we
can keep the standalone aspect of the ibmqx machine, but we need to incorporate
it as module into our work. Concerning this, ibmqx module should be able to:
   
a. Run designated circuits
b. Interact effectively with the IBM device
c. Return counts for a variety of different devices
d. Optional communication with IBM server

Optionally:

i  .  read in qasm
ii .  use the error simulator
iii.
iv .
v  .

 

# 5.11.18 

Plan for constructing program. Need to edit output so it can be handled better.
Namely, need to:
- Change the output format of the QC code 
- Include a 'write input file', i.e., a write config text, for the main program
- Make components

Program should be as follows:
1. Generate starting file. File has locations for:
    - 1 and 2 electron integrals
    Also, includes the information for the run.

2. Begin run. Generate an input file, test the quantum computer or simulator, and
   return the 1-RDM or respective values. 

3. Evaluate Hamiltonian to calculate trial energy. 

4. Run optimizer to generate new points

5. Call subroutine again to recalculate the energy.
