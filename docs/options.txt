# Paritally updated 7/30/18, Scott Smart
#
# Describes current key word options and their effect on the systems. 

#
# Currently, there are 4 classes of keywords -
# 1. General keywords
# 2. Occupation keywords (for the ON optimizer)
# 3. Orbital keywords (for orbital optimizations)
# 4. IBM keywords (for ''occ_energy= qc'') 
#
#
#
 1. Optimizer Keywords
#
#
#
#

seed= 
    'pre.seed_run'
    DEFAULT= 'default'

    Seeds the initial guess. If 'default', then it will be seeded at 
    some point like (0,0,0). 

optimizer= 
    'pre.opt_method'
    DEFAULT= 'NM'

    Specifies current optimization method:
        Nelder-Mead= 'NM'
        -Simplex method
        -Very good convergence typically
        -No need for gradients 
        
        Gradient Descent= 'GD'
        -Gradient method with numerical gradients
       

method= 
    'pre.method'
    DEFAULT= 'project'

    Specifies method of doing fermionic tomography.
        'project'
        -expects only the diagonal elements - most simple tomography
        -needs a preferably diagonal work of the WF

        'stretch'
        -expects only diagonal elements, but stretchs the space accessible by the QC system

        'project_1rdm'
        -expects the diagonal and off diagonal elements and projects 
         them onto a GPC surface. currently only for 3qubit systems.

        'measure_2rdm'
        -performs full 2-rdm tomography. works in theory, but not in
         practice yet. 

connect=
    'pre.connect'
    DEFAULT= 'yes'

    Connect to the ibm system or not. Not recommended for local simulation
    as it will slow runs down. 

print=
    'pre.print_extra'
    DEFAULT= 'no'

    Specifies whether to have a verbose print with some diagnostic things. 


opt_crit= 
    'pre.opt_conv_criteria'
    DEFAULT= 'default'

    Should be specific to the optimizer. Nelder-Mead for instance uses the 
    standard deviation of the points on the simplex so as to converge to
    as small enough area. Can also be area, difference in energies, etc.
    Default will set it to the most appropriate. 

increase=
    'pre.increase_runs'
    DEFAULT= 'false'

    Will increase the number of runs as you get closer to a good solution.
    Probably needs some work, but good idea to save time at the outset.

chem_orb=
    'pre.chem_orbitals'
    DEFAULT= 'FCI'

    Specifies the orbitals used. Any options but FCI will require the use
    of an orbital optimization program.

    'FCI' - uses the Full CI orbitals; not ideal, but useful for quick opt
    'HF'  - generates the HF orbitals, more general application

energy=
    'pre.energy'
    DEFAULT= 'qc'
    
    Options for whether to do a quantum or classical optimization. Might
    invalidate the method. 

    'qc': 
        -calculates energy with the CI coefficient optimization done with
         the quantum computer

    'classical':
        -calculated energy classically - good for benchmarking
    
mapping=  
    'pre.mapping'
    DEFAULT='zeta'

    See functions folder. Specifies mapping from WF to energy calc.

max_iter=
    'pre.max_iterations'
    DEFAULT= 50

    Specifies maximum optimization iterations

 2. IBMQX Quantum Computer Keywords
#
#
#
#

backend= 
    'pre.use_backend'
    DEFAULT: 'local_qasm_simulator'

    Sets the backend for use in the simulator, current options are:
        - local_qasm_simulator
        - ibmqx_qasm_simulator (requires connect= True)
        - local_unitary_simulator
        - ibmqx2 (requires connect= True)
        - ibmqx4 (requires connect= True)


run_type= 
    'pre.run_type'
    DEFAULT: single
    
    Outdated, see 1. seed

algorithm=
    'pre.algorithm'
    DEFAULT: 'alpha'

    Very important, specifies the quantum algorithm, or quantum circuit. 
    Note that ibmqx algorithms are actually 5 qubit measurements, and so 
    changes have to be made to the algorithm. 

num_shots= 
    'pre.num_shots'
    DEFAULT: 1024

    Specifies number of shots

order=
    'pre.qubit_order'
    DEFAULT: 'default'

    Specifies ordering of qubits in transformation - keep as default

pass= 
    'pre.pass_true'
    DEFAULT: 'yes'

    Specifies whether or not to pass the check statements. Necessary for 
    ibmqx runs, where you want to double check credits and such. Needs to
    be turned off for pbs runs. 

tomography=
    'pre.run_tomography'
    DEFAULT: 'no' 'False'

    Runs the ibmqx tomography circuit. Should not be necessary. Need to 
    alter this key word for specifying 1-RDM and 2-RDM tomography. Might 
    simply be defined by the types in 1.
