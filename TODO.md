    * Try and fix todo file
    * Figure out which passes are supported by PassManager
        * Read up on transpile/passmanager functionality
    * Figure out a way to get a non stochastic transpilation (maybe slack)
    * Check if approach is best way to do this
    * Continue to think of other ways to approach error mitigation, 
    * Do some preliminary testing, configure so that it is realtively easy to do
