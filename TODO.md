### 5/24/2019

* Backend/Transpiler
    * ~~Create file which takes in QASM and performs transpilation~~
    * ~~Figure out which passes are supported by PassManager for parameters~~
        * ~~Read up on transpile/passmanager functionality~~
    * ~~Figure out a way to get a consistent transpilation (maybe slack)~~
* Error Mitigation
    * ~~Development of well-suited error mitigation in the algorithm~~
    * Continue to think of other ways to approach error mitigation, 
    * ~~Do some preliminary testing, configure so that it is realtively easy to do~~
