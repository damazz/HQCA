# Hybrid Quantum Classical Algorithm for Quantum Chemistry Computation
Program which can perform a variety of quantum calculations for use in quantum
chemistry. Ideal for small molecules and small circuits which do not require
extensive fermionic mapping. Single point energy is the the default run type,
although geometry optimizations are included as well. 

Also, some capabilities for confirming results with classical quantum
calculations are present as well.

## Getting Started:

### Prerequisites:
python >= 3.5
QISKIT >= 0.6.1
IBMQuantumExperience >= 1.9.8
pyscf (and prerequisite packs) >= 1.4.6
numpy >= 1.14.1

### Installing:
Nothing too important besides having python and the corresponding modules. Need
to configure the Qconfig file if you want to run actual tests.
