Finished a number of jobs over weekend and on Monday. Still, need to restart a
few:
h3_7 - almost done, need to restart
h3_6 - needs more time, def need to restart 
h3_5 - very close, just needs a little more time
h3_0 - need to restart completely

Calculated the triangle with the ibm.txt file, going to try convergence for some
simple points in the h3 curve and see what happens with it. 

tri: 20180811.default.tri 

3 point calibration, ran successfully
run on the ibmqx4
20180811.default.txt - contains run parameter

Found a good time to run the samples, also changed how the runs are loaded.
Sadly however, the run couldnt be completed, so might need to start over
depending on the calibration date. 

Also, found out that previous runs were not run on the ibmqx4 machine, and so
had to delete them. There is hope for running samples, but it needs likely
90-120 minutes of free time, so the weekend is probably gonig to be the only
time to run samples. Or have it running on a server where the runs can just keep
going. i.e. set up for smart-home.
