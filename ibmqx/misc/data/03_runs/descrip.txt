Here there is basic processing for the march runs. In particular, in our
original runs iht the 6 parameter quantum algrithm, there was a CNOT gate
which was switched and so some of the point in the set were no longer a
certain distance apart from one another.

So, e06 was a solution to this. with _1 _2 _3 contaiing the new runs for this
data set. However, only _2 completed correctly, with _3 having a partial
finish, and so there are singular runs which will need to be discarded. 
_4 and _5 finished the set, although there are a few erronious _4 runs as
well. 

The filtering in this folder is to reconcile all of the data points so that we
have a cohesive set, and eventually to combine it with the March data set as
well.
