The /analysis/ folder has a twofold function. First, it compiles mulitple
results into one coherent dataset. Second, it allows for multiple types of
analysis based on that specific dataset.

The assembler takes multiple file inputs, and then looks for the '.txt' and '.err'
files asociated with them. It then makes a large dataset, with set precision,
which is written to the '/analysis/compiled/' folder with a designated name.
Notably the file then contains the occupation numbers, degrees of rotation for each
transformation, and then the order of the transformation.

The analysis program takes an input file from '/analysis/compiled/', and
allows for multiple analysis types, detailed below:

-----
1. 'pairplot'
-----
Allows for comparison of user input variables taken from the data set, such as
angular dependence, or error plots versus ordering, or etc. 

-----
2. 'histograms'
-----
Will plot error histograms with a specific ordering. 

-----
3. 'gpc'
-----
Plots the occupations nubmers lambda1, lambda2, and lambda3 in a outlined GPC
polytope. Coloring corresponds with those that satisfy the GPC and those that
do not. 

-----
4. 'gpc_error'
-----
# still needed to be coded up

Plots the occupations number lambda1, lambda2, and lambda3 with an shaded GPC
polytope as in 3. Coloring corresponds with absolute error.
